# Group Project #3: SellElegant

This is a student group project in which a Full Stack MERN application is created and deployed to Heroku.

The goal of this project is to create a full stack MERN application that allows users to create an account, login, create a project by selecting from a menu of service options and then submit the project for production. Users will also be able to search their projects and see which ones are in process and which projects have been completed.

The project will be deployed to Heroku and will use GraphQL and Apollo for the backend and React for the front end. The project will also use JWT for user authentication and authorization. It is a MERN stack application with the addition of GraphQL and Apollo.
